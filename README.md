### Hi I'm Andy 👋
<!-- 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Java and Android Projects

I'm an easy going person, who wants to be a part of a great company. I like working in a team and give some ideas to make a project more creative.
I hope to be a junior Java Developer specializing in Web Development and Android applications. I feel well in HTML5, CSS, MySQL, Java.
